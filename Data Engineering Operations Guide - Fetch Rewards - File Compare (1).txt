Summary:
Fetch Rewards has asked that the Data Engineer Team develop an algorithm to calculate a metric to compare two files and determine how similar they are.   Documents that are the same will return a value of 1, and files that do not match at all, will return a value of 0.  


CSR Number/s: 
* CSR000101 – Fetch Rewards Metric Project.  


Program Name:
* Folder: Adhoc 
* Fetch_Data_Challenge.ipynb        


Production Support (Support Priority):
* Currently If this job goes down, it can wait until normal business hours to resolve.

Data Engineer:                                 Kevin Ducat
Data  Architect:                        Camron Khan


Runtime Instructions:
Currently this program is developed in Python via Jupyter Notebook.    


High level Process  Flow:  
Read 2 files, and produce the metric.
.
Scheduler Daily Flow:  
Currently this process is ran on an ad-hoc bases and is not in the daily batch schedule.

Data Sources:
* sample1.txt
* sample2.txt
* sample3.txt
             
Data Target:
* Matching Value = 
   * Number of Values Matched between the files 
   * divided by the Number of Values in either Dictionary
* Value of 1 is fully matching
* Value of 0 has no matching values


Assumptions:
* Punctuation will not be used in the compare.
* Case will not be used in the compare.


Future Considerations:
* Reevaluate the logic of the metric
* Convert the code from Jupyter Notebook to native Python for the ability to package as a Web Service or Docker Container.
